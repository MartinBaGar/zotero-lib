PLIP, the protein--ligand interaction profiler, detects and visualises these interactions and provides data in formats suitable for further processing. PLIP has proven very successful in applications ranging from the characterisation of docking experiments to the assessment of novel ligand--protein complexes. Besides ligand--protein interactions, interactions with DNA and RNA play a vital role in many applications, such as drugs targeting DNA or RNA-binding proteins. To date, over 7\% of all 3D structures in the Protein Data Bank include DNA or RNA. Therefore, we extended PLIP to encompass these important molecules. We demonstrate the power of this extension with examples of a cancer drug binding to a DNA target, and an RNA--protein complex central to a neurological disease. PLIP is available online at https://plip-tool.biotec.tu-dresden.de and as open source code. So far, the engine has served over a million queries and the source code has been downloaded several thousand times.},

AutoDock Vina (`Vina') is a widely used docking tool with parallelization for speed. QuickVina (`QVina 1') then further enhanced the speed via a heuristics, requiring high exhaustiveness. With low exhaustiveness, its accuracy was compromised. We present in this article the latest version of QuickVina (`QVina 2') that inherits both the speed of QVina 1 and the reliability of the original Vina.Results: We tested the efficacy of QVina 2 on the core set of PDBbind 2014. With the default exhaustiveness level of Vina (i.e. 8), a maximum of 20.49-fold and an average of 2.30-fold acceleration with a correlation coefficient of 0.967 for the first mode and 0.911 for the sum of all modes were attained over the original Vina. A tendency for higher acceleration with increased number of rotatable bonds as the design variables was observed. On the accuracy, Vina wins over QVina 2 on 30\% of the data with average energy difference of only 0.58\,kcal/mol. On the same dataset, GOLD produced RMSD smaller than 2\,{\AA} on 56.9\% of the data while QVina 2 attained 63.1\%.Availability and implementation: The C++ source code of QVina 2 is available at (www.qvina.org).Contact: ~aalhossary@pmail.ntu.edu.sgSupplementary information: ~Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract = {In the last few years, the deep learning (DL) computing paradigm has been deemed the Gold Standard in the machine learning (ML) community. Moreover, it has gradually become the most widely used computational approach in the field of ML, thus achieving outstanding results on several complex cognitive tasks, matching or even beating those provided by human performance. One of the benefits of DL is the ability to learn massive amounts of data. The DL field has grown fast in the last few years and it has been extensively used to successfully address a wide range of traditional applications. More importantly, DL has outperformed well-known ML techniques in many domains, e.g., cybersecurity, natural language processing, bioinformatics, robotics and control, and medical information processing, among many others. Despite it has been contributed several works reviewing the State-of-the-Art on DL, all of them only tackled one aspect of the DL, which leads to an overall lack of knowledge about it. Therefore, in this contribution, we propose using a more holistic approach in order to provide a more suitable starting point from which to develop a full understanding of DL. Specifically, this review attempts to provide a more comprehensive survey of the most important aspects of DL and including those enhancements recently added to the field. In particular, this paper outlines the importance of DL, presents the types of DL techniques and networks. It then presents convolutional neural networks (CNNs) which the most utilized DL network type and describes the development of CNNs architectures together with their main features, e.g., starting with the AlexNet network and closing with the High-Resolution network (HR.Net). Finally, we further present the challenges and suggested solutions to help researchers understand the existing research gaps. It is followed by a list of the major DL applications. Computational tools including FPGA, GPU, and CPU are summarized along with a description of their influence on DL. The paper ends with the evolution matrix, benchmark datasets, and summary and conclusion.},

A brief background of AI, and specifically machine learning (ML) algorithms, is provided including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), generative adversarial networks (GANs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). We categorize creative applications into five groups, related to how AI technologies are used: (i) content creation, (ii) information analysis, (iii) content enhancement and post production workflows, (iv) information extraction and enhancement, and (v) data compression. We critically examine the successes and limitations of this rapidly advancing technology in each of these areas. We further differentiate between the use of AI as a creative tool and its potential as a creator in its own right. We foresee that, in the near future, ML-based AI will be adopted widely as a tool or collaborative assistant for creativity. In contrast, we observe that the successes of ML in domains with fewer constraints, where AI is the `creator', remain modest. The potential of AI (or its developers) to win awards for its original creations in competition with human creatives is also limited, based on contemporary technologies. We therefore conclude that, in the context of creative industries, maximum benefit from AI will be derived where its focus is human-centric---where it is designed to augment, rather than replace, human creativity.},

EndoU-dependent cleavage was detected in every region of MHV RNA, from the 5{$\prime$} NTR to the 3{$\prime$} NTR, including transcriptional regulatory sequences (TRS). Cleavage at two CA dinucleotides immediately adjacent to the MHV poly(A) tail suggests a mechanism to suppress negative-strand RNA synthesis and the accumulation of viral dsRNA. MHV with EndoU (EndoU               mut               ) or 2{$\prime$}--5{$\prime$} phosphodiesterase (PDE               mut               ) mutations provoked the activation of RNase L in BMM, with corresponding cleavage of RNAs by RNase L. The physiologic targets of EndoU are viral RNA templates required for negative-strand RNA synthesis and dsRNA accumulation.

  abstract = {The chemokine receptor CCR5 plays an important role in leukocyte chemotaxis and activation, and also acts as a coreceptor for human and simian immunodeficiency viruses (HIV-1, HIV-2, and SIV). We provide evidence that CCR5 is O-glycosylated on serine 6 in the NH2 terminus. The O-linked glycans, particularly sialic acid moieties, significantly contribute to binding of the chemokine ligands. By contrast, removal of O-linked oligosaccharide exerted little effect on HIV-1 infection. Sulfation of specific tyrosine residues in the CCR5 NH2 terminus was important for efficient {$\beta$}-chemokine binding. Thus, as has been observed for the binding of selectins and their ligands, O-linked carbohydrates and tyrosine sulfates play major roles in promoting the interaction of chemokines with CCR5. The resulting flexible arrays of negative charges on the CCR5 surface may allow specific, high-affinity interactions with diverse chemokine ligands. Although this is the first example of O-linked oligosaccharides and tyrosine sulfates playing a role in chemokine binding, the high density of serines, threonines and tyrosines in the N-termini of many CC chemokine receptors suggests that these posttranslational modifications may commonly contribute to chemokine binding.},

  abstract = {Cervical carcinoma is a global public health burden. Given that it is usually asymptomatic at potentially curative stages, the development of clinically accurate tests is critical for early detection and individual risk stratification. The present study performed an integrative meta-analysis of the transcriptomes from 10 cervical carcinoma cohorts, with the aim of identifying biomarkers that are associated with malignant transformation of cervical epithelium, and establish their clinical applicability. From among the top ranked differentially expressed genes, flap structure-specific endonuclease 1 (FEN1) and poly (U)-specific endoribonuclease (ENDOU) were selected for further validation, and their clinical applicability was assessed using immunohistochemically stained microarrays comprising 110 tissue cores, using p16 and Ki67 staining as the comparator tests. The results demonstrated that FEN1 expression was significantly upregulated in 65\% of tumor specimens (P=0.0001), with no detectable expression in the non-tumor tissues. Furthermore, its expression was significantly associated with Ki67 staining in tumor samples (P{$<$}0.0001), but no association was observed with p16 expression or the presence of human papilloma virus types 16/18, patient age, tumor grade or stage. FEN1 staining demonstrated lower sensitivity than p16 (69.3 vs. 96.8\%) and Ki67 (69.3 vs. 76.3\%); however, the specificity was identical to p16 and higher than that of Ki67 (100 vs. 71.4\%).ENDOU staining was consistent with the microarray results, demonstrating 1\% positivity in tumors and 40\% positivity in non-tumor tissues. Gene set enrichment analysis of cervical tumors overexpressing FEN1 revealed its association with enhanced growth factor signaling, immune response inhibition and extracellular matrix remodeling, whereas tumors with low ENDOU expression exhibited inhibition of epithelial development and differentiation processes. Taken together, the results of the present study demonstrate the feasibility of the integrative meta-analysis approach to identify relevant biomarkers associated with cervical carcinogenesis. Thus, FEN1 and ENDOU may be useful diagnostic biomarkers for squamous cervical carcinoma. However, further studies are required to determine their diagnostic performance in larger patient cohorts and validate the results presented here.},

Viruses resistant to these compounds are able to bind the inhibitor-CCR5 complex while also interacting with the free coreceptor. CCR5 also interacts intracellularly with G proteins, as part of its signal transduction functions, and this process alters its conformation. Here we investigated whether the action of VVC against inhibitor-sensitive and -resistant viruses is affected by whether or not CCR5 is coupled to G proteins such as G{$\alpha$}                i                . Treating CD4                +                T cells with pertussis toxin to uncouple the G{$\alpha$}                i                subunit from CCR5 increased the potency of VVC against the sensitive viruses and revealed that VVC-resistant viruses use the inhibitor-bound form of G{$\alpha$}                i                -coupled CCR5 more efficiently than they use uncoupled CCR5. Supportive evidence was obtained by expressing a signaling-deficient CCR5 mutant with an impaired ability to bind to G proteins, as well as two constitutively active mutants that activate G proteins in the absence of external stimuli. The implication of these various studies is that the association of intracellular domains of CCR5 with the signaling machinery affects the conformation of the external and transmembrane domains and how they interact with small-molecule inhibitors of HIV-1 entry.},

However, evaluation of drug-likeness in absolute terms does not reflect adequately the whole spectrum of compound quality. More worryingly, widely used rules may inadvertently foster undesirable molecular property inflation as they permit the encroachment of rule-compliant compounds towards their boundaries. We propose a measure of drug-likeness based on the concept of desirability called the quantitative estimate of drug-likeness (QED). The empirical rationale of QED reflects the underlying distribution of molecular properties. QED is intuitive, transparent, straightforward to implement in many practical settings and allows compounds to be ranked by their relative merit. We extended the utility of QED by applying it to the problem of molecular target druggability assessment by prioritizing a large set of published bioactive compounds. The measure may also capture the abstract notion of aesthetics in medicinal chemistry.},

The advancements in deep learning and artificial intelligence (AI) have triggered an avalanche of ideas on how to translate such techniques to a variety of domains including the field of drug design. A range of architectures have been devised to find the optimal way of generating chemical compounds by using either graph- or string (SMILES)-based representations. With this application note, we aim to offer the community a production-ready tool for de novo design, called REINVENT. It can be effectively applied on drug discovery projects that are striving to resolve either exploration or exploitation problems while navigating the chemical space. It can facilitate the idea generation process by bringing to the researcher's attention the most promising compounds. REINVENT's code is publicly available at https://github.com/MolecularAI/Reinvent.},

Here, we assess the pocket estimation methods' influence on druggability predictions by comparing statistical models constructed from pockets estimated using different pocket estimation methods: a proximity of either 4 or 5.5 {\AA} to a cocrystallized ligand or DoGSite and fpocket estimation methods. We developed PockDrug, a robust pocket druggability model that copes with uncertainties in pocket boundaries. It is based on a linear discriminant analysis from a pool of 52 descriptors combined with a selection of the most stable and efficient models using different pocket estimation methods. PockDrug retains the best combinations of three pocket properties which impact druggability: geometry, hydrophobicity, and aromaticity. It results in an average accuracy of 87.9\% {\textpm} 4.7\% using a test set and exhibits higher accuracy ({$\sim$}5-10\%) than previous studies that used an identical apo set. In conclusion, this study confirms the influence of pocket estimation on pocket druggability prediction and proposes PockDrug as a new model that overcomes pocket estimation variability.},

  abstract = {The last few years have seen the development of numerous deep learning-based protein-ligand docking methods. They offer huge promise in terms of speed and accuracy. However, despite claims of state-of-the-art performance in terms of crystallographic root-mean-square deviation (RMSD), upon closer inspection, it has become apparent that they often produce physically implausible molecular structures. It is therefore not sufficient to evaluate these methods solely by RMSD to a native binding mode. It is vital, particularly for deep learning-based methods, that they are also evaluated on steric and energetic criteria. We present PoseBusters, a Python package that performs a series of standard quality checks using the well-established cheminformatics toolkit RDKit. Only methods that both pass these checks and predict native-like binding modes should be classed as having "state-of-the-art" performance. We use PoseBusters to compare five deep learning-based docking methods (DeepDock, DiffDock, EquiBind, TankBind, and Uni-Mol) and two well-established standard docking methods (AutoDock Vina and CCDC Gold) with and without an additional post-prediction energy minimisation step using a molecular mechanics force field. We show that both in terms of physical plausibility and the ability to generalise to examples that are distinct from the training data, no deep learning-based method yet outperforms classical docking tools. In addition, we find that molecular mechanics force fields contain docking-relevant physics missing from deep-learning methods. PoseBusters allows practitioners to assess docking and molecular generation methods and may inspire new inductive biases still required to improve deep learning-based methods, which will help drive the development of more accurate and more realistic predictions.},

  abstract = {We introduce a novel multilevel enhanced sampling strategy grounded on Gaussian-accelerated Molecular Dynamics (GaMD). First, we propose a GaMD multi-GPUs-accelerated implementation within the Tinker-HP molecular dynamics package. We introduce the new ``dual-water'' mode and its use with the flexible AMOEBA polarizable force field. By adding harmonic boosts to the water stretching and bonding terms, it accelerates the solvent--solute interactions while enabling speedups, thanks to the use of fast multiple--time step integrators. To further reduce the time-to-solution, we couple GaMD to Umbrella Sampling (US). The GaMD-US/dual-water approach is tested on the 1D Potential of Mean Force (PMF) of the solvated CD2--CD58 system (168\,000 atoms), allowing the AMOEBA PMF to converge within 1 kcal/mol of the experimental value. Finally, Adaptive Sampling (AS) is added, enabling AS--GaMD capabilities but also the introduction of the new Adaptive Sampling--US--GaMD (ASUS--GaMD) scheme. The highly parallel ASUS--GaMD setup decreases time to convergence by, respectively, 10 and 20 times, compared to GaMD--US and US. Overall, beside the acceleration of PMF computations, Tinker-HP now allows for the simultaneous use of Adaptive Sampling and GaMD-''dual water'' enhanced sampling approaches increasing the applicability of polarizable force fields to large-scale simulations of biological systems.},

  abstract = {The accurate scoring of rigid-body docking orientations represents one of the major difficulties in protein-protein docking prediction. Other challenges are the development of faster and more efficient sampling methods and the introduction of receptor and ligand flexibility during simulations. Overall, good discrimination of near-native docking poses from the very early stages of rigid-body protein docking is essential step before applying more costly interface refinement to the correct docking solutions. Here we explore a simple approach to scoring of rigid-body docking poses, which has been implemented in a program called pyDock. The scheme is based on Coulombic electrostatics with distance dependent dielectric constant, and implicit desolvation energy with atomic solvation parameters previously adjusted for rigid-body protein-protein docking. This scoring function is not highly dependent on specific geometry of the docking poses and therefore can be used in rigid-body docking sets generated by a variety of methods. We have tested the procedure in a large benchmark set of 80 unbound docking cases. The method is able to detect a near-native solution from 12,000 docking poses and place it within the 100 lowest-energy docking solutions in 56\% of the cases, in a completely unrestricted manner and without any other additional information. More specifically, a near-native solution will lie within the top 20 solutions in 37\% of the cases. The simplicity of the approach allows for a better understanding of the physical principles behind protein-protein association, and provides a fast tool for the evaluation of large sets of rigid-body docking poses in search of the near-native orientation.},

  abstract = {Dataset scaling, also known as normalization, is an essential preprocessing step in a machine learning pipeline. It is aimed at adjusting attributes scales in a way that they all vary within the same range. This transformation is known to improve the performance of classification models, but there are several scaling techniques to choose from, and this choice is not generally done carefully. In this paper, we execute a broad experiment comparing the impact of 5 scaling techniques on the performances of 20 classification algorithms among monolithic and ensemble models, applying them to 82 publicly available datasets with varying imbalance ratios. Results show that the choice of scaling technique matters for classification performance, and the performance difference between the best and the worst scaling technique is relevant and statistically significant in most cases. They also indicate that choosing an inadequate technique can be more detrimental to classification performance than not scaling the data at all. We also show how the performance variation of an ensemble model, considering different scaling techniques, tends to be dictated by that of its base model. Finally, we discuss the relationship between a model's sensitivity to the choice of scaling technique and its performance and provide insights into its applicability on different model deployment scenarios.

  abstract = {Molecular simulations can elucidate atomistic-level mechanisms of key biological processes, which are often hardly accessible to experiment. However, the results of the simulations can only be as trustworthy as the underlying simulation model. In many of these processes, interactions between charged moieties play a critical role. Current empirical force fields tend to overestimate such interactions, often in a dramatic way, when polyvalent ions are involved. The source of this shortcoming is the missing electronic polarization in these models. Given the importance of such biomolecular systems, there is great interest in fixing this deficiency in a computationally inexpensive way without employing explicitly polarizable force fields. Here, we review the electronic continuum correction approach, which accounts for electronic polarization in a mean-field way, focusing on its charge scaling variant. We show that by pragmatically scaling only the charged molecular groups, we qualitatively improve the charge--charge interactions without extra computational costs and benefit from decades of force field development on biomolecular force fields.},

Recent large-scale genomic studies have revealed the presence of various alterations in the genes encoding RTKs such as EGFR, HER2/ErbB2, and MET, amongst many others. Abnormal RTK activation in human cancers is mediated by four principal mechanisms: gain-of-function mutations, genomic amplification, chromosomal rearrangements, and / or autocrine activation. In this manuscript, we review the processes whereby RTKs are activated under normal physiological conditions and discuss several mechanisms whereby RTKs can be aberrantly activated in human cancers. Understanding of these mechanisms has important implications for selection of anti-cancer therapies.},

The antibody-mediated, immune-checkpoint blockade turned out to a promising method for immunotherapy against advanced melanoma. Metformin, a drug prescribed for patients with type 2 diabetes, has been recognized to have anti-cancer effect. We found that CD8               +               tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) is a target of metformin. CD8               +               TILs inevitably undergo immune exhaustion, characterized by diminished production of multiple cytokines such as IL-2, TNF{$\alpha$}, and IFN{$\gamma$}, followed by elimination with apoptosis. Metformin is able to counter the state. Along with conventional therapy, treatment of cancer patients with metformin may have a great advantage for cancer therapy.                        ,                             Metformin, a prescribed drug for type 2 diabetes, has been reported to have anti-cancer effects; however, the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. Here we show that this mechanism may be immune-mediated. Metformin enabled normal but not T-cell--deficient SCID mice to reject solid tumors. In addition, it increased the number of CD8               +               tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and protected them from apoptosis and exhaustion characterized by decreased production of IL-2, TNF{$\alpha$}, and IFN{$\gamma$}. CD8               +               TILs capable of producing multiple cytokines were mainly PD-1               -               Tim-3               +               , an effector memory subset responsible for tumor rejection. Combined use of metformin and cancer vaccine improved CD8               +               TIL multifunctionality. The adoptive transfer of antigen-specific CD8               +               T cells treated with metformin concentrations as low as 10 {$\mu$}M showed efficient migration into tumors while maintaining multifunctionality in a manner sensitive to the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) inhibitor compound C. Therefore, a direct effect of metformin on CD8               +               T cells is critical for protection against the inevitable functional exhaustion in the tumor microenvironment.},

Much is known about RNA degradation in Eukarya and Bacteria, but there is limited information about RNA-degrading enzymes and RNA destabilizing or stabilizing elements in the domain of the Archaea. The recent progress in the understanding of the structure and function of the archaeal exosome, a protein complex with RNA-degrading and RNA-tailing capabilities, has given some first insights into the mechanisms of RNA degradation in the third domain of life and into the evolution of RNA-degrading enzymes. Moreover, other archaeal RNases with degrading potential have been described and a new mechanism for protection of the 5'-end of RNA in Archaea was discovered. Here, we summarize the current knowledge on RNA degradation in the Archaea. Additionally, RNA degradation mechanisms in Rhodobacter capsulatus and Pseudomonas syringae are compared to those in the major model organism for Gram-negatives, Escherichia coli, which dominates our view on RNA degradation in Bacteria.},

The expression of this chemokine by macrophages is up-modulated as a consequence of viral infection or gp120 exposure. In this study, we show for the first time that the phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C (PC-PLC) is required for the production of CCL2 triggered by gp120 in human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). Using a combination of pharmacologic inhibition, confocal laser-scanner microscopy, and enzymatic activity assay, we demonstrate that R5 gp120 interaction with CCR5 activates PC-PLC, as assessed by a time-dependent modification of its subcellular distribution and a concentration-dependent increase of its enzymatic activity. Furthermore, PC-PLC is required for NF-kB--mediated CCL2 production triggered by R5 gp120. Notably, PC-PLC activation through CCR5 is specifically induced by gp120, since triggering CCR5 through its natural ligand CCL4 (MIP-1{$\beta$}) does not affect PC-PLC cellular distribution and enzymatic activity, as well as CCL2 secretion, thus suggesting that different signaling pathways can be activated through CCR5 interaction with HIV-1 or chemokine ligands. The identification of PC-PLC as a critical mediator of well-defined gp120-mediated effects in MDMs unravels a novel mechanism involved in bystander activation and may contribute to define potential therapeutic targets to block Env-triggered pathologic responses.},

  abstract = {Many biological processes are regulated by allosteric mechanisms that communicate with distant sites in the protein responsible for functionality. The binding of a small molecule at an allosteric site typically induces conformational changes that propagate through the protein along allosteric pathways regulating enzymatic activity. Elucidating those communication pathways from allosteric sites to orthosteric sites is, therefore, essential to gain insights into biochemical processes. Targeting the allosteric pathways by mutagenesis can allow the engineering of proteins with desired functions. Furthermore, binding small molecule modulators along the allosteric pathways is a viable approach to target reactions using allosteric inhibitors/activators with temporal and spatial selectivity. Methods based on network theory can elucidate protein communication networks through the analysis of pairwise correlations observed in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using molecular descriptors that serve as proxies for allosteric information. Typically, single atomic descriptors such as {$\alpha$}-carbon displacements are used as proxies for allosteric information. Therefore, allosteric networks are based on correlations revealed by that descriptor. Here, we introduce a Python software package that provides a comprehensive toolkit for studying allostery from MD simulations of biochemical systems. MDiGest offers the ability to describe protein dynamics by combining different approaches, such as correlations of atomic displacements or dihedral angles, as well as a novel approach based on the correlation of Kabsch-Sander electrostatic couplings. MDiGest allows for comparisons of networks and community structures that capture physical information relevant to allostery. Multiple complementary tools for studying essential dynamics include principal component analysis, root mean square fluctuation, as well as secondary structure-based analyses.},

  abstract = {CCR5 acts as the principal coreceptor during HIV-1 transmission and early stages of infection. Efficient HIV-1 entry requires a series of processes, many dependent on the conformational state of both viral envelope protein and cellular receptor. Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) are able to identify different CCR5 conformations, allowing for their use as probes to distinguish CCR5 populations. Not all CCR5 MAbs are able to reduce HIV-1 infection, suggesting the use of select CCR5 populations for entry. In the U87.CD4.CCR5-GFP cell line, we used such HIV-1-restricting MAbs to probe the relation between localization, trafficking and G protein association for individual CCR5 conformations. We find that CCR5 conformations not only exhibit different localization and abundance patterns throughout the cell, but that they also display distinct sensitivities to endocytosis inhibition. Using chemokine analogs that vary in their HIV-1 inhibitory mechanisms, we also illustrate that responses to ligand engagement are conformation-specific. Additionally, we provide supporting evidence for the select sensitivity of conformations to G protein association. Characterizing the link between the function and dynamics of CCR5 populations has implications for understanding their selective targeting by HIV-1 and for the development of inhibitors that will block CCR5 utilization by the virus.},

  abstract = {One of the main challenges in drug discovery is predicting protein-ligand binding affinity. Recently, machine learning approaches have made substantial progress on this task. However, current methods of model evaluation are overly optimistic in measuring generalization to new targets, and there does not exist a standard dataset of sufficient size to compare performance between models. We present a new dataset for structure-based machine learning, the CrossDocked2020 set, with 22.5 million poses of ligands docked into multiple similar binding pockets across the Protein Data Bank, and perform a comprehensive evaluation of grid-based convolutional neural network (CNN) models on this dataset. We also demonstrate how the partitioning of the training data and test data can impact the results of models trained with the PDBbind dataset, how performance improves by adding more lower-quality training data, and how training with docked poses imparts pose sensitivity to the predicted affinity of a complex. Our best performing model, an ensemble of five densely connected CNNs, achieves a root mean squared error of 1.42 and Pearson R of 0.612 on the affinity prediction task, an AUC of 0.956 at binding pose classification, and a 68.4\% accuracy at pose selection on the CrossDocked2020 set. By providing data splits for clustered cross-validation and the raw data for the CrossDocked2020 set, we establish the first standardized dataset for training machine learning models to recognize ligands in non-cognate target structures while also greatly expanding the number of poses available for training. In order to facilitate community adoption of this dataset for benchmarking protein-ligand binding affinity prediction, we provide our models, weights, and the CrossDocked2020 set at https://github.com/gnina/models.,},

XendoU has no homology to any known cellular RNase, although it has sequence similarity with proteins tentatively annotated as serine proteases. It has been recently shown that XendoU represents the cellular counterpart of a nidovirus replicative endoribonuclease (NendoU), which plays a critical role in viral replication and transcription. In this paper, we combined prediction and experimental data to define the amino acid residues directly involved in XendoU catalysis. Specifically, we find that XendoU residues Glu-161, Glu-167, His-162, His-178, and Lys-224 are essential for RNA cleavage, which occurs in the presence of manganese ions. Furthermore, we identified the RNA sequence required for XendoU binding and showed that the formation of XendoU-RNA complex is Mn2+-independent.},

The samples were obtained from normal human placenta, umbilical cord, uterine cervix, endometrium, ovary and vulva. The most differentiated trophoblastic cells, the syncytiotrophoblasts, as well as the intermediate trophoblast cells contained PP4. PP4 immunoreactivity was present in umbilical cord as well. Occasionally PP4 was detected in normal ovarian, endometrial or vulvar tissue samples. Cervix and myometrium were free of PP4 immunoreactive material. PP4 staining was cytoplasmic. Our findings indicate that PP4 cannot be considered specific for the placenta since it is present in some human adult tissues as well.},

These methods offer the promise of higher-quality molecule generation by explicitly modelling the 3D interaction between a potential drug and a protein receptor. However, previous work has primarily focused on the quality of the generated molecules themselves, with limited evaluation of the 3D molecule {\textbackslash}emph\{poses\} that these methods produce, with most work simply discarding the generated pose and only reporting a "corrected" pose after redocking with traditional methods. Little is known about whether generated molecules satisfy known physical constraints for binding and the extent to which redocking alters the generated interactions. We introduce PoseCheck, an extensive analysis of multiple state-of-the-art methods and find that generated molecules have significantly more physical violations and fewer key interactions compared to baselines, calling into question the implicit assumption that providing rich 3D structure information improves molecule complementarity. We make recommendations for future research tackling identified failure modes and hope our benchmark can serve as a springboard for future SBDD generative modelling work to have a real-world impact.},

A key characteristic of sHsps is that they exist in ensembles of iso-energetic oligomeric species differing in size. This property arises from a unique mode of assembly involving several parts of the subunits in a flexible manner. Current evidence suggests that smaller oligomers are more active chaperones. Thus, a shift in the equilibrium of the sHsp ensemble allows regulating the chaperone activity. Different mechanisms have been identified that reversibly change the oligomer equilibrium. The promiscuous interaction with non-native proteins generates complexes that can form aggregate-like structures from which native proteins are restored by ATP-dependent chaperones such as Hsp70 family members. In recent years, this basic paradigm has been expanded, and new roles and new cofactors, as well as variations in structure and regulation of sHsps, have emerged.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {In vivo, small heat-shock proteins (sHsps) are key players in maintaining a healthy proteome. {$\alpha$}B-crystallin ({$\alpha$}B-c) or HspB5 is one of the most widespread and populous of the ten human sHsps. Intracellularly, {$\alpha$}B-c acts via its molecular chaperone action as the first line of defence in preventing target protein unfolding and aggregation under conditions of cellular stress. In this review, we explore how the structure of {$\alpha$}B-c confers its function and interactions within its oligomeric self, with other sHsps, and with aggregation-prone target proteins. Firstly, the interaction between the two highly conserved regions of {$\alpha$}B-c, the central {$\alpha$}-crystallin domain and the C-terminal IXI motif and how this regulates {$\alpha$}B-c chaperone activity are explored. Secondly, subunit exchange is rationalised as an integral structural and functional feature of {$\alpha$}B-c. Thirdly, it is argued that monomeric {$\alpha$}B-c may be its most chaperone-species active, but at the cost of increased hydrophobicity and instability. Fourthly, the reasons why hetero-oligomerisation of {$\alpha$}B-c with other sHsps is important in regulating cellular proteostasis are examined. Finally, the interaction of {$\alpha$}B-c with aggregation-prone, partially folded target proteins is discussed. Overall, this paper highlights the remarkably diverse capabilities of {$\alpha$}B-c as a caretaker of the cell.},

Usually, all serralysin secretors have on the same operon a gene coding for a periplasmic 10-kDa protein, which is an inhibitor of the secreted protease. The recent characterization of the inhibitor of the alkaline protease from \emph{Pseudomonas aeruginosa} revealed a surprisingly low dissociation constant of 4 pm, contrary to earlier studies on homologous systems, where inhibition constants in the {$\mu$}m range were reported. To approach a more accurate understanding, the crystal structure of the complex between inhibitor and protease from \emph{P. aeruginosa} was determined at 1.74 {\AA} resolution and refined to\emph{R}\textsubscript{free} = 0.204. The structure reported here shows clearly that the N terminus of the inhibitor forms a coordinative bond to the catalytic Zn\textsuperscript{2+} ion with a nitrogen--zinc distance of 2.17 {\AA}.

However, traditional in silico methods are limited by computational inefficiency, while machine learning approaches face bottlenecks due to auto-regressive sampling. To address these concerns, we have developed a conditional deep generative model, PMDM, for 3D molecule generation fitting specified targets. PMDM consists of a conditional equivariant diffusion model with both local and global molecular dynamics, enabling PMDM to consider the conditioned protein information to generate molecules efficiently. The comprehensive experiments indicate that PMDM outperforms baseline models across multiple evaluation metrics. To evaluate the applications of PMDM under real drug design scenarios, we conduct lead compound optimization for SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) and Cyclin-dependent Kinase 2 (CDK2), respectively. The selected lead optimization molecules are synthesized and evaluated for their in-vitro activities against CDK2, displaying improved CDK2 activity.},

  abstract = {By using an enzyme-bridge immunoperoxidase (PAP) technique, localization of so-called pregnancy-specific beta 1-glycoprotein (SP1) and placental-specific tissue proteins (PP5, PP10, PP11, PP12) was investigated in 19 cases of breast cancer, 24 cases of testicular malignant tumours, 12 cases of gastric cancer and some cases of other malignant tumours. These five glycoproteins isolated from human term placentae and characterized by Bohn are localised mainly in the cytoplasm, or nucleus of syncytiotrophoblast and appear to be specific for the trophoblast. But to a certain percentage these proteins could also be detected in the cytoplasma of malignant cells: In breast cancer, SP1 was present in 52.6\% of cases, PP5 in 63.2\%, PP10 in 68.4\%, PP11 in 55.6\% and PP12 in 31.6\%. In testicular malignant tumours the detection rates of these proteins varied from 20.8 to 75.0\% and in gastric cancer from 41.7 to 66.7\%. In total 50\% of the tumours tested were SP1-positive, 58.3\% PP5-positive, 55.6\% PP10-positive, 38.0\% PP11-positive and 31.9\% PP12-positive. In addition, it was found that mononuclear histiocytes showed a strong cytoplasmic staining for PP10 and PP12 and that a few other non-cancerous cells (i.e. striated cells in gastric metaplasia, gastric polyps etc.) stained for PP5, PP10, PP11 and/or PP12. All control sections were negative in malignant cells as well as in other tissue cells. This study confirms the reports that some kinds of malignant tumours produce SP1 and indicates that the ectopic production of proteins normally produced by the trophoblast is a common finding in malignant tumours. It furthermore suggests that such proteins may be useful as markers in monitoring patients with malignant diseases. The possible mechanisms of ectopic production of these inappropriate proteins in malignant tumours are discussed.},

The results were basically the same throughout pregnancy. The syncytiotrophoblast of villi showed clear positive stainings for SP1, PP8, PP9, and PP11, whereas the cytotrophoblast (villi) was found to show clear positive staining for PP9 only. The main sources of proteins related to SP1, PP9, and PP11 were the syncytiotrophoblast cells of the villi and PP8, the syncytiotrophoblast cells of villi as well as the chorionic trophoblast cells. PP12 was mainly located in histiocytes found in the decidua, umbilical cord, amnion, and chorion. There were only traces of PP5 and PP10 in the placentae of cynomolgus monkeys throughout gestation. As in human placentae some granulocyte-like blood cells in the intervillous space were strongly positive for PP8, PP10, and PP12. The findings in the afterbirth of cynomolgus monkeys were similar to those in the human; the monkey could thus serve as a model for the investigation of the new placental proteins.},

The cryo-EM 3D structure of HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) subunit gp120 in complex with CD4 and CCR5 has provided important structural insights into HIV-1/host cell interaction, yet it has not explained the signaling properties of Env nor the fact that CCR5 exists in distinct forms that show distinct Env binding properties. We used classical molecular dynamics and site-directed mutagenesis to characterize the CCR5 conformations stabilized by four gp120s, from laboratory-adapted and primary HIV-1 strains, and which were previously shown to bind differentially to distinct CCR5 forms and to exhibit distinct cellular tropisms. The comparative analysis of the simulated structures reveals that the different gp120s do indeed stabilize CCR5 in different conformational ensembles. They differentially reorient extracellular loops 2 and 3 of CCR5 and thus accessibility to the transmembrane binding cavity. They also reshape this cavity differently and give rise to different positions of intracellular ends of transmembrane helices 5, 6 and 7 of the receptor and of its third intracellular loop, which may in turn influence the G protein binding region differently. These results suggest that the binding of gp120s to CCR5 may have different functional outcomes, which could result in different properties for viruses.},

The roots of this plant have been in use in the Indian system of medicine for more than twenty five centuries for treatments of various ailments. It has shown anticancer activities, however, the anticancer and anti-metastatic effects of plumbagin are largely unknown against cervical cancer cells. Herein, we investigated the molecular alterations associated with plumbagin-mediated inhibition of growth, survival and epithelial to mesenchymal transition of human cervical cancer SiHa and HeLa cells. Plumbagin (1--4 {$\mu$}M) caused a significant decrease in the cell viability and increased the cell death in SiHa and Hela cells after 24 and 48 h. Plumbagin also caused strong G2/M and S-G2/M phase cell cycle arrest in SiHa and HeLa cells, respectively which was accompanied by a decrease in the expression of cyclin and CDK levels. The expression levels of both mRNAs and proteins of cyclin B1, A and E2 and CDK 1 and 2 decreased after 24 and 48 h. Plumbagin strongly induced apoptosis along with increased ratio of Bax : Bcl2 and cleavage of caspase 3, 9, and PARP. Plumbagin caused a significant increase in reactive oxygen species generation which mediated cell death as it was attenuated by pre-treatment with N-acetyl cysteine. Additionally, we also report for the first time that plumbagin possesses an anti-metastatic effect at non-cytotoxic doses that was accompanied by the modulation of MMP-2, 9, E-cadherin, N-cadherin, {$\beta$}-catenin and vimentin. Taken together, our findings suggest that plumbagin has strong anticancer and anti-metastatic effects against human cervical cancer cells.},

However, the majority of current deep generative models are ligand-based and do not consider chemical knowledge in the molecular generation process, often resulting in a relatively low success rate. We herein propose a structure-based molecular generative framework with chemical knowledge explicitly considered (named PocketFlow), which generates novel ligand molecules inside protein binding pockets. In various computational evaluations, PocketFlow showed state-of-the-art performance, with generated molecules being 100\% chemically valid and highly drug-like. Ablation experiments prove the critical role of chemical knowledge in ensuring the validity and drug-likeness of the generated molecules. We applied PocketFlow to two new target proteins that are related to epigenetic regulation, HAT1 and YTHDC1, and successfully obtained wet-lab validated bioactive compounds. The binding modes of the active compounds with target proteins are close to those predicted by molecular docking and further confirmed by the X-ray crystal structure. All the results suggest that PocketFlow is a useful deep generative model, capable of generating innovative bioactive molecules from scratch given a protein binding pocket.},

Overexpression of UHRF1 has been found in many kinds of tumors and its overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and short survival in certain cancer types. However, its function in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is not clear. Here we report that RCC tumor tissues had obviously higher UHRF1 expression than normal renal tissues. Downregulation of UHRF1 by siRNA or shRNA in RCC cell lines resulted in decreased cell viability, inhibited cell migration and invasion, and increased apoptosis. UHRF1 knockdown RCC xenografts also resulted in obviously inhibited tumor growth in vivo. After downregulation of UHRF1 in RCC cells, the expression of TXNIP was upregulated. In addition, after UHRF1 and TXNIP were simultaneously downregulated, cell viability and cell invasion increased, whereas cell apoptosis decreased compared with UHRF1 single downregulated cells. We also showed that UHRF1 could recruit HDAC1 to the TXNIP promoter and mediate the deacetylation of histone H3K9, resulting in the inhibition of TXNIP expression. Our results confirm that UHRF1 has oncogenic function in RCC and UHRF1 may promote tumor progression through epigenetic regulation of TXNIP. UHRF1 might be used as a therapeutic target for RCC treatment.},

Numerous studies have been conducted to seek molecular targets to treat TNBC effectively, but chemotherapy is still the main choice for patients with TNBC. We have previously presented evidence of the important roles of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5 (CCL5) in TNBC tumor growth and metastasis. These experiments highlighted the importance of the crosstalk between cancer cells and stromal lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) in tumor growth and metastasis. METHODS: We examined the viability and migration of MDA-MB-231-LN, SUM149, and SUM159 cells co-cultured with LECs when treated with maraviroc (CCR5 inhibitor) and tocilizumab (anti-IL-6 receptor antibody). To assess the anti-tumor effects of the combination of these two drugs in an athymic nude mouse model, MDA-MB-231-LN cells were implanted in the mammary fat pad and maraviroc (8~mg/kg, orally daily) and cMR16-1 (murine surrogate of the anti-IL-6R antibody, 10~mg/kg, IP, 3~days a week) were administrated for 5~weeks and effects on tumor growth and thoracic metastasis were measured. RESULTS: In this study, we used maraviroc and tocilizumab to confirm that IL-6 and CCL5 signaling are key pathways promoting TNBC cell proliferation and migration. Further, in a xenograft mouse model, we showed that tumor growth was dramatically inhibited by cMR16-1, the mouse version of the anti-IL6R antibody. The combination of maraviroc and cMR16-1 caused significant reduction of TNBC tumor growth compared to the single agents. Significantly, the combination of maraviroc and cMR16-1 abrogated thoracic metastasis. CONCLUSION: Taken together, these findings show that IL-6 and CCL5 signaling, which promote crosstalk between TNBC and lymphatic vessels, are key enhancers of TNBC tumor growth and metastasis. Furthermore, these results demonstrate that a drug combination inhibiting these pathways may be a promising therapy for TNBC patients.},

  abstract = {Comparative or homology protein structure modeling is severely limited by errors in the alignment of a modeled sequence with related proteins of known three-dimensional structure. To ameliorate this problem, we have developed an automated method that optimizes both the alignment and the model implied by it. This task is achieved by a genetic algorithm protocol that starts with a set of initial alignments and then iterates through re-alignment, model building and model assessment to optimize a model assessment score. During this iterative process: (i) new alignments are constructed by application of a number of operators, such as alignment mutations and cross-overs; (ii) comparative models corresponding to these alignments are built by satisfaction of spatial restraints, as implemented in our program MODELLER; (iii) the models are assessed by a variety of criteria, partly depending on an atomic statistical potential. When testing the procedure on a very difficult set of 19 modeling targets sharing only 4--27\% sequence identity with their template structures, the average final alignment accuracy increased from 37 to 45\% relative to the initial alignment (the alignment accuracy was measured as the percentage of positions in the tested alignment that were identical to the reference structure-based alignment). Correspondingly, the average model accuracy increased from 43 to 54\% (the model accuracy was measured as the percentage of the C{$\alpha$} atoms of the model that were within 5 {\AA} of the corresponding C{$\alpha$} atoms in the superposed native structure). The present method also compares favorably with two of the most successful previously described methods, PSI-BLAST and SAM. The accuracy of the final models would be increased further if a better method for ranking of the models were available.},

  abstract = {This is a short paper on new ways to think about the structure and function of small heat shock proteins (sHSPs), perhaps the most enigmatic family among protein chaperones. The goal is to incorporate new observations regarding the disordered regions of small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) into the large body of structural information on the conserved structural alpha-crystallin domains (ACD) that define the sHSP family. Disordered regions (N-terminal region and C-terminal region or NTR and CTR, respectively) represent over 50\% of the sHSP sequence space in the human genome and are refractory to traditional structural biology approaches, posing a roadblock on the path towards a mechanistic understanding of how sHSPs function. A model in which an ACD dimer serves as a template that presents three grooves into which other proteins or other segments of sHSPs can bind is presented. Short segments within the disordered regions are observed to bind into the ACD grooves. There are more binding segments than there are grooves, and each binding event is weak and transient, creating a dynamic equilibrium of tethered and untethered disordered regions. The ability of an NTR to be in dynamic equilibrium between tethered/sequestered and untethered states suggests several mechanistic alternatives that need not be mutually exclusive. New ways of thinking about (and approaching) the intrinsic properties of sHSPs may finally allow the veil of enigma to be removed from sHSPs.},

  abstract = {Molecular simulations are a computational technique used to investigate the dynamics of proteins and other molecules. The free energy landscape of these simulations is often rugged, and minor differences in the initial velocities, floating-point precision, or underlying hardware can cause identical simulations (replicas) to take different paths in the landscape. In this study we investigated the magnitude of these effects based on 310\,000 ns of simulation time. We performed 100 identically parametrized replicas of 3000 ns each for a small 10 amino acid system as well as 100 identically parametrized replicas of 100 ns each for an 827 residue T-cell receptor/MHC system. Comparing randomly chosen subgroups within these replica sets, we estimated the reproducibility and reliability that can be achieved by a given number of replicas at a given simulation time. These results demonstrate that conclusions drawn from single simulations are often not reproducible and that conclusions drawn from multiple shorter replicas are more reliable than those from a single longer simulation. The actual number of replicas needed will always depend on the question asked and the level of reliability sought. On the basis of our data, it appears that a good rule of thumb is to perform a minimum of five to 10 replicas.},

To assist in understanding the flexible protein--ligand interactions, we constructed the Pocketome, an encyclopedia of about one thousand experimentally solved conformational ensembles of druggable binding sites in proteins, grouped by location and consistent chain/cofactor composition. The multiplicity of pockets within the ensembles adds an extra, fourth dimension to the Pocketome entry data. Within each ensemble, the pockets were carefully classified by the degree of their pairwise similarity and compatibility with different ligands. The core of the Pocketome is derived regularly and automatically from the current releases of the Protein Data Bank and the Uniprot Knowledgebase; this core is complemented by entries built from manually provided seed ligand locations. The Pocketome website (www.pocketome.org) allows searching for the sites of interest, analysis of conformational clusters, important residues, binding compatibility matrices and interactive visualization of the ensembles using the ActiveICM web browser plugin. The Pocketome collection can be used to build multi-conformational docking and 3D activity models as well as to design cross-docking and virtual ligand screening benchmarks.},

TXNIP becomes rapidly induced by IRE1{$\alpha$}, an ER bifunctional kinase/endoribonuclease (RNase). Hyperactivated IRE1{$\alpha$} increases TXNIP mRNA stability by reducing levels of a TXNIP destabilizing microRNA, miR-17. In turn, elevated TXNIP protein activates the NLRP3 inflammasome, causing procaspase-1 cleavage and interleukin 1{$\beta$} (IL-1{$\beta$}) secretion. Txnip gene deletion reduces pancreatic {$\beta$} cell death during ER stress and suppresses diabetes caused by proinsulin misfolding in the Akita mouse. Finally, small molecule~IRE1{$\alpha$} RNase inhibitors suppress TXNIP production to block IL-1{$\beta$} secretion. In summary, the IRE1{$\alpha$}-TXNIP pathway is used in the terminal UPR to promote sterile inflammation and programmed cell death and may be targeted to develop effective treatments for cell degenerative diseases.},

Preclinical and clinical evaluations of a variety of Hsp90 inhibitors have shown antitumor effect as a single agent and in combination with chemotherapy.

The different functions of Hsp90 isoforms and the isoform selectivity of drugs need further investigation.

  abstract = {Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The viral outbreak started in late 2019 and rapidly became a serious health threat to the global population. COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. Several therapeutic options have been adopted to prevent the spread of the virus. Although vaccines have been developed, antivirals are still needed to combat the infection of this virus. SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus, and its genome encodes polyproteins that can be processed into structural and nonstructural proteins. Maturation of viral proteins requires cleavages by proteases. Therefore, the main protease (3 chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) or Mpro) encoded by the viral genome is an attractive drug target because it plays an important role in cleaving viral polyproteins into functional proteins. Inhibiting this enzyme is an efficient strategy to block viral replication. Structural studies provide valuable insight into the function of this protease and structural basis for rational inhibitor design. In this review, we describe structural studies on the main protease of SARS-CoV-2. The strategies applied in developing inhibitors of the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 and currently available protein inhibitors are summarized. Due to the availability of high-resolution structures, structure-guided drug design will play an important role in developing antivirals. The availability of high-resolution structures, potent peptidic inhibitors, and diverse compound scaffolds indicate the feasibility of developing potent protease inhibitors as antivirals for COVID-19.},

  abstract = {Isoforms A (LGB-A) and B (LGB-B) of bovine lactoglobulin, the milk protein, differ in positions 64 (D{$\leftrightarrow$}G) and 118 (V{$\leftrightarrow$}A). Interactions of LGB-A and LGB-B with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), dodecyltrimethylammonium chloride (DTAC) and lauric acid (LA), 12-carbon ligands possessing differently charged polar groups, were investigated using isothermal titration calorimetry and X-ray crystallography, to study the proton linkage phenomenon and to distinguish between effects related to different isoforms and different ligand properties. The determined values of {$\Delta$}S and {$\Delta$}H revealed that for all ligands, binding is entropically driven. The contribution from enthalpy change is lower and shows strong dependence on type of buffer that indicates proton release from the protein varying with protein isoform and ligand type and involvement of LA and Asp64 (in isoform A) in this process. The ligand affinities for both isoforms were arranged in the same order, DTAC {$<$} LA {$<$} SDS, and were systematically lower for variant B. The entropy change of the complexation process was always higher for isoform A, but these values were compensated by changes in enthalpy, resulting in almost identical {$\Delta$}G for complexes of both isoforms. The determined crystal structures showed that substitution in positions 64 and 118 did not influence the overall structure of LGB complexes. The chemical character of the ligand polar group did not affect the position of its aliphatic chain in protein {$\beta$}-barrel, indicating a major role of hydrophobic interactions in ligand binding that prevailed even with the repulsion between positively charged DTAC and lysine residues located at binding site entrance.

  abstract = {Many biological processes are regulated by allosteric mechanisms that communicate with distant sites in the protein responsible for functionality. The binding of a small molecule at an allosteric site typically induces conformational changes that propagate through the protein along allosteric pathways regulating enzymatic activity. Elucidating those communication pathways from allosteric sites to orthosteric sites is, therefore, essential to gain insights into biochemical processes. Targeting the allosteric pathways by mutagenesis can allow the engineering of proteins with desired functions. Furthermore, binding small molecule modulators along the allosteric pathways is a viable approach to target reactions using allosteric inhibitors/activators with temporal and spatial selectivity. Methods based on network theory can elucidate protein communication networks through the analysis of pairwise correlations observed in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using molecular descriptors that serve as proxies for allosteric information. Typically, single atomic descriptors such as {$\alpha$}-carbon displacements are used as proxies for allosteric information. Therefore, allosteric networks are based on correlations revealed by that descriptor. Here, we introduce a Python software package that provides a comprehensive toolkit for studying allostery from MD simulations of biochemical systems. MDiGest offers the ability to describe protein dynamics by combining different approaches, such as correlations of atomic displacements or dihedral angles, as well as a novel approach based on the correlation of Kabsch--Sander electrostatic couplings. MDiGest allows for comparisons of networks and community structures that capture physical information relevant to allostery. Multiple complementary tools for studying essential dynamics include principal component analysis, root mean square fluctuation, as well as secondary structure-based analyses.},

Txnip is simultaneously a critical regulator of energy metabolism. Other alpha-arrestin proteins also play key roles in cell biology and cancer. Recent Advances: Txnip expression is regulated by multilayered mechanisms, including transcriptional regulation, microRNA, messenger RNA (mRNA) stabilization, and protein degradation. The Txnip-based connection between cancer and metabolism has been widely recognized. Meanwhile, new aspects are proposed for the mechanism of action of Txnip, including the regulation of RNA expression and autophagy. Arrestin domain containing 3 (ARRDC3), another {$\alpha$}-arrestin protein, regulates endocytosis and signaling, whereas ARRDC1 and ARRDC4 regulate extracellular vesicle formation. Critical Issues: The mechanism of action of Txnip is yet to be elucidated. The regulation of intracellular protein trafficking by arrestin family proteins has opened an emerging field of biology and medical research, which needs to be examined further. Future Directions: A fundamental understanding of the mechanism of action of Txnip and other arrestin family members needs to be explored in the future to combat diseases such as cancer and diabetes.

  abstract = {A protein structure model generally needs to be evaluated to assess whether or not it has the correct fold. To improve fold assessment, four types of a residue-level statistical potential were optimized, including distance-dependent, contact, {$\phi$}/{$\Psi$} dihedral angle, and accessible surface statistical potentials. Approximately 10,000 test models with the correct and incorrect folds were built by automated comparative modeling of protein sequences of known structure. The criterion used to discriminate between the correct and incorrect models was the Z-score of the model energy. The performance of a Z-score was determined as a function of many variables in the derivation and use of the corresponding statistical potential. The performance was measured by the fractions of the correctly and incorrectly assessed test models. The most discriminating combination of any one of the four tested potentials is the sum of the normalized distance-dependent and accessible surface potentials. The distance-dependent potential that is optimal for assessing models of all sizes uses both C{$\alpha$} and C{$\beta$} atoms as interaction centers, distinguishes between all 20 standard residue types, has the distance range of 30 {\AA}, and is derived and used by taking into account the sequence separation of the interacting atom pairs. The terms for the sequentially local interactions are significantly less informative than those for the sequentially nonlocal interactions. The accessible surface potential that is optimal for assessing models of all sizes uses C{$\beta$} atoms as interaction centers and distinguishes between all 20 standard residue types. The performance of the tested statistical potentials is not likely to improve significantly with an increase in the number of known protein structures used in their derivation. The parameters of fold assessment whose optimal values vary significantly with model size include the size of the known protein structures used to derive the potential and the distance range of the accessible surface potential. Fold assessment by statistical potentials is most difficult for the very small models. This difficulty presents a challenge to fold assessment in large-scale comparative modeling, which produces many small and incomplete models. The results described in this study provide a basis for an optimal use of statistical potentials in fold assessment.},

The common assumption is that these effects are mediated through regulation of heat-shock protein (HSP) expression. However, the transcriptional network that HSF1 coordinates directly in malignancy and its relationship to the heat-shock response have never been defined. By comparing cells with high and low malignant potential alongside their nontransformed counterparts, we identify an HSF1-regulated transcriptional program specific to highly malignant cells and distinct from heat shock. Cancer-specific genes in this program support oncogenic processes: cell-cycle regulation, signaling, metabolism, adhesion and translation. HSP genes are integral to this program, however, many are uniquely regulated in malignancy. This HSF1 cancer program is active in breast, colon and lung tumors isolated directly from human patients and is strongly associated with metastasis and death. Thus, HSF1 rewires the transcriptome in tumorigenesis, with prognostic and therapeutic implications.},

  abstract = {Immune checkpoint blockade therapy is perhaps the most important development in cancer treatment in recent memory. It is based on decades of investigation into the biology of immune cells and the role of the immune system in controlling cancer growth. While the molecular circuitry that governs the immune system in general-and antitumor immunity in particular-is intensely studied, far less attention has been paid to the role of cellular stress in this process. Proteostasis, intimately linked to cell stress responses, refers to the dynamic regulation of the cellular proteome and is maintained through a complex network of systems that govern the synthesis, folding, and degradation of proteins in the cell. Disruption of these systems can result in the loss of protein function, altered protein function, the formation of toxic aggregates, or pathologies associated with cell stress. However, the importance of proteostasis extends beyond its role in maintaining proper protein function; proteostasis governs how tolerant cells may be to mutations in protein-coding genes and the overall half-life of proteins. Such gene expression changes may be associated with human diseases including neurodegenerative diseases, metabolic disease, and cancer and manifest at the protein level against the backdrop of the proteostasis network in any given cellular environment. In this review, we focus on the role of proteostasis in regulating immune responses against cancer as well the role of proteostasis in determining immunogenicity of cancer cells.},

Without the need to set predefined reaction coordinates, GaMD enables unconstrained enhanced sampling of the biomolecules. Furthermore, by constructing a boost potential that follows a Gaussian distribution, accurate reweighting of GaMD simulations is achieved via cumulant expansion to the second order. The free energy profiles obtained from GaMD simulations allow us to identify distinct low energy states of the biomolecules and characterize biomolecular structural dynamics quantitatively. In this chapter, we present the theory of GaMD, its implementation in the widely used molecular dynamics software packages (AMBER and NAMD), and applications to the alanine dipeptide biomolecular model system, protein folding, biomolecular large-scale conformational transitions and biomolecular recognition.},

Here, we present the first structure of a prokaryotic EndoU toxin in complex with its cognate immunity protein. The contact-dependent growth inhibition toxin CdiA-CTSTECO31 from Escherichia coli STEC\_O31 adopts the eukaryotic EndoU fold and shares greatest structural homology with the nuclease domain of coronavirus Nsp15. The toxin contains a canonical His-His-Lys catalytic triad in the same arrangement as eukaryotic EndoU domains, but lacks the uridylate-specific ribonuclease activity that characterizes the superfamily. Comparative sequence analysis indicates that bacterial EndoU domains segregate into at least three major clades based on structural variations in the N-terminal subdomain. Representative EndoU nucleases from clades I and II degrade tRNA molecules with little specificity. In contrast, CdiA-CTSTECO31 and other clade III toxins are specific anticodon nucleases that cleave tRNAGlu between nucleotides C37 and m2 A38. These findings suggest that the EndoU fold is a versatile scaffold for the evolution of novel substrate specificities. Such functional plasticity may account for the widespread use of EndoU effectors by diverse inter-bacterial toxin delivery systems.},

TXNIP is a regulator of the cellular redox state, but its role in pancreatic beta-cells and the mechanism of its regulation by glucose remain unknown. We therefore generated a stable transfected beta-cell line (INS-1) overexpressing human TXNIP and found that TXNIP overexpression induced apoptosis as assessed by Bax, Bcl2, caspase-3, and cleaved caspase-9 as well as Hoechst staining. Interestingly, islets of insulin-resistant/diabetic mice (AZIP-F1, BTBRob/ob) demonstrated elevated TXNIP expression, suggesting that TXNIP may play a role in glucotoxicity and the beta-cell loss observed under these conditions. Furthermore, we found that glucose-induced TXNIP transcription is not dependent on glucose metabolism and is mediated by a distinct carbohydrate response element (ChoRE) in the human TXNIP promoter consisting of a perfect nonpalindromic repeat of two E-boxes. Transfection studies demonstrated that this ChoRE was necessary and sufficient to confer glucose responsiveness. Thus, TXNIP is a novel proapoptotic beta-cell gene elevated in insulin resistance/diabetes and up-regulated by glucose through a unique ChoRE and may link glucotoxicity and beta-cell apoptosis.},

Mordred can be easily installed and used in the command line interface, as a web application, or as a high-flexibility Python package on all major platforms (Windows, Linux, and macOS). Performance benchmark results show that Mordred is at least twice as fast as the well-known PaDEL-Descriptor and it can calculate descriptors for large molecules, which cannot be accomplished by other software. Owing to its good performance, convenience, number of descriptors, and a lax licensing constraint, Mordred is a promising choice of molecular descriptor calculation software that can be utilized for cheminformatics studies, such as those on quantitative structure--property relationships.},

CCR5 has been shown to be palmitoylated and targeted to cholesterol- and sphingolipid-rich membrane microdomains termed ``lipid rafts.'' However, the role of cholesterol and lipid rafts on chemokine binding and signaling through CCR5 remains unknown. We found that cholesterol extraction by hydroxypropyl-{$\beta$}-cyclodextrin (BCD) significantly reduced the binding and signaling of macrophage inflammatory protein 1{$\beta$} (MIP-1{$\beta$}) using CCR5-expressing CEM-NKR T cells. Reloading treated cells with cholesterol but not 4-cholesten-3-one, an oxidized form of cholesterol, restored MIP-1{$\beta$} binding to BCD-treated cells. Antibodies specific for distinct CCR5 epitopes lost their ability to bind to the cell surface after cholesterol extraction to varying degrees. Moreover, cells stained with fluorescently labeled MIP-1{$\beta$} extensively colocalized with the GM1 lipid raft marker while using anti-CCR5 antibodies; most of CCR5 on these cells only partially colocalized with GM1, suggesting that active ligand binding facilitates receptor association with lipid rafts or that raft association promotes a higher affinity conformation of CCR5. Together, these data demonstrate that cholesterol and lipid rafts are important for the maintenance of the CCR5 conformation and are necessary for both the binding and function of this chemokine receptor.},

In this study, we found that HSP90 was cleaved to a 55kDa protein after treatment with proteasome inhibitors including MG132 in leukemia cells but was not cleaved in other tissue-derived cells. HSP90 has two major isoforms (HSP90{$\alpha$} and HSP90{$\beta$}), and both were cleaved by MG132 treatment. MG132 treatment also induced a decrease in HSP90 client proteins. MG132 treatment generated ROS, and the cleavage of HSP90 was blocked by a ROS scavenger, N-acetylcysteine (NAC). MG132 activated several caspases, and the activation was reduced by pretreatment with NAC. Based on an inhibitor study, the cleavage of HSP90 induced by MG132 was dependent on caspase 10 activation. Furthermore, active recombinant caspase 10 induced HSP90 cleavage in vitro. MG132 upregulated VDUP-1 expression and reduced the GSH levels implying that the regulation of redox-related proteins is involved. Taken all together, our results suggest that the cleavage of HSP90 by MG132 treatment is mediated by ROS generation and caspase 10 activation. HSP90 cleavage may provide an additional mechanism involved in the anti-cancer effects of proteasome inhibitors.},

Thus, simultaneous inhibition of all Hsp90 paralogs is a reasonable strategy for cancer therapy. However, since the existing pan-Hsp90 inhibitor does not accumulate in mitochondria, the potential anticancer activity of pan-Hsp90 inhibition has not yet been fully examined in vivo. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas database revealed that all Hsp90 paralogs were upregulated in prostate cancer. Inactivation of all Hsp90 paralogs induced mitochondrial dysfunction, increased cytosolic calcium, and activated calcineurin. Active calcineurin blocked prosurvival heat shock responses upon Hsp90 inhibition by preventing nuclear translocation of HSF1. The purine scaffold derivative DN401 inhibited all Hsp90 paralogs simultaneously and showed stronger anticancer activity than other Hsp90 inhibitors. Pan-Hsp90 inhibition increased cytotoxicity and suppressed mechanisms that protect cancer cells, suggesting that it is a feasible strategy for the development of potent anticancer drugs.

Several antioxidants have been exploited in recent years for their actual or supposed beneficial effect against oxidative stress, such as vitamin E, flavonoids, and polyphenols. While we tend to describe oxidative stress just as harmful for human body, it is true as well that it is exploited as a therapeutic approach to treat clinical conditions such as cancer, with a certain degree of clinical success.

  abstract = {While divalent ions are known to be involved in key biological processes such as RNA folding or DNA-histone interactions, these interactions are poorly captured in molecular dynamics simulations with empirical force fields, which suffer from strong overbinding artefacts. Hence, there is a high need for improved descriptions of (diva- lent) ions in nucleic acid simulations. In this work, we explore the possibility to improve ion-binding properties of the popular Amber-OL15 force field using the Electronic Con- tinuum Approach (ECC), which includes electronic polarization through charge scaling, limited here to the phosphate backbone. This strategy yields very promising results, with essentially no degradation of the conformational properties of a broad range of DNA (and a ds-RNA) sequences, and a strong improvement of both monovalent ion retention in G-quadruplexes and divalent ion pairing. As the ECC modification appears mostly orthogonal to force field refinements focused on backbone dihedral parameters, this work suggests a generalizable way to improve ion pairing properties of nucleic acids in all-atom MD simulations.},

We describe herein the structure-guided optimization of a series of inhibitors of the coronavirus 3C-like protease (3CLpro), an enzyme essential for viral replication. The optimized compounds were effective against several human coronaviruses including MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 in an enzyme assay and in cell-based assays using Huh-7 and Vero E6 cell lines. Two selected compounds showed antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2 in cultured primary human airway epithelial cells. In a mouse model of MERS-CoV infection, administration of a lead compound 1 day after virus infection increased survival from 0 to 100\% and reduced lung viral titers and lung histopathology. These results suggest that this series of compounds has the potential to be developed further as antiviral drugs against human coronaviruses.},

  abstract = {Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) play a key role in eukaryotic ribosome biogenesis. In most cases, snoRNAs are encoded in introns and are released through the splicing reaction. Some snoRNAs are, instead, produced by an alternative pathway consisting of endonucleolytic processing of pre-mRNA. XendoU, the endoribonuclease responsible for this activity, is a U-specific, metal-dependent enzyme that releases products with 2{$\prime$}--3{$\prime$} cyclic phosphate termini. XendoU is broadly conserved among eukaryotes, and it is a genetic marker of nidoviruses, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, where it is essential for replication and transcription. We have determined by crystallography the structure of XendoU that, by refined search methodologies, appears to display a unique fold. Based on sequence conservation, mutagenesis, and docking simulations, we have identified the active site. The conserved structural determinants of this site may provide a framework for attempting to design antiviral drugs to interfere with the infectious nidovirus life cycle.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Twenty years ago, the landmark AM1 was introduced, and has since had an increasingly wide following among chemists due to its consistently good results and time-tested reliability---being presently available in countless computational quantum chemistry programs. However, semiempirical molecular orbital models still are of limited accuracy and need to be improved if the full potential of new linear scaling techniques, such as MOZYME and LocalSCF, is to be realized. Accordingly, in this article we present RM1 (Recife Model 1): a reparameterization of AM1. As before, the properties used in the parameterization procedure were: heats of formation, dipole moments, ionization potentials and geometric variables (bond lengths and angles). Considering that the vast majority of molecules of importance to life can be assembled by using only six elements: C, H, N, O, P, and S, and that by adding the halogens we can now build most molecules of importance to pharmaceutical research, our training set consisted of 1736 molecules, representative of organic and biochemistry, containing C, H, N, O, P, S, F, Cl, Br, and I atoms. Unlike AM1, and similar to PM3, all RM1 parameters have been optimized. For enthalpies of formation, dipole moments, ionization potentials, and interatomic distances, the average errors in RM1, for the 1736 molecules, are less than those for AM1, PM3, and PM5. Indeed, the average errors in kcal {$\cdot$} mol               -1               of the enthalpies of formation for AM1, PM3, and PM5 are 11.15, 7.98, and 6.03, whereas for RM1 this value is 5.77. The errors, in Debye, of the dipole moments for AM1, PM3, PM5, and RM1 are, respectively, 0.37, 0.38, 0.50, and 0.34. Likewise, the respective errors for the ionization potentials, in eV, are 0.60, 0.55, 0.48, and 0.45, and the respective errors, in angstroms, for the interatomic distances are 0.036, 0.029, 0.037, and 0.027. The RM1 average error in bond angles of 6.82{$^\circ$} is only slightly higher than the AM1 figure of 5.88{$^\circ$}, and both are much smaller than the PM3 and PM5 figures of 6.98{$^\circ$} and 9.83{$^\circ$}, respectively. Moreover, a known error in PM3 nitrogen charges is corrected in RM1. Therefore, RM1 represents an improvement over AM1 and its similar successor PM3, and is probably very competitive with PM5, which is a somewhat different model, and not fully disclosed. RM1 possesses the same analytical construct and the same number of parameters for each atom as AM1, and, therefore, can be easily implemented in any software that already has AM1, not requiring any change in any line of code, with the sole exception of the values of the parameters themselves. {\copyright} 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract = {Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is a complication of diabetes whose pathophysiology is linked to altered mitochondrial bioenergetics (mtBE). KU-596 is a small molecule neurotherapeutic that reverses symptoms of DPN, improves sensory neuron mtBE, and decreases the pro-oxidant protein, thioredoxin-interacting protein (Txnip) in a heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70)-dependent manner. However, the mechanism by which KU-596 improves mtBE and the role of Txnip in drug efficacy remains unknown. Mitophagy is a quality-control mechanism that selectively targets damaged mitochondria for degradation. The goal of this study was to determine if KU-596 therapy improved DPN, mtBE, and mitophagy in an Hsp70- and Txnip-dependent manner. Mito-QC (MQC) mice express a mitochondrially targeted mCherry-GFP fusion protein that enables visualizing mitophagy. Diabetic MQC, MQC {\texttimes} Hsp70 knockout (KO), and MQC {\texttimes} Txnip KO mice developed sensory and nerve conduction dysfunctions consistent with the onset of DPN. KU-596 therapy improved these measures, and this was dependent on Hsp70 but not Txnip. In MQC mice, diabetes decreased mtBE and increased mitophagy and KU-596 treatment reversed these effects. In contrast, KU-596 was unable to improve mtBE and decrease mitophagy in MQC {\texttimes} Hsp70 and MQC {\texttimes} Txnip KO mice. These data suggest that Txnip is not necessary for the development of the sensory symptoms and mitochondrial dysfunction induced by diabetes. KU-596 therapy may improve mitochondrial tolerance to diabetic stress to decrease mitophagic clearance in an Hsp70- and Txnip-dependent manner.},

The P. aeruginosa genome also encodes the highly potent and specific APR peptide inhibitor (APRin). However, the structural reason for the significant inhibition has not been revealed. Using ab initio molecular simulations, we here investigated the specific interactions between APR and APRin to elucidate which amino acid residues of APRin and APR contribute strongest to the inhibition. Since APR has a Zn2+ ion at the ligand-binding site and histidine and glutamic acid residues are coordinated with Zn2+, it is essential to precisely describe these coordination bonds to elucidate the specific interactions between APR and APRin. Therefore, we employed the ab initio fragment molecular orbital method to investigate the specific interactions at an electronic level. The results revealed that Ser1 and Ser2 at the N-terminus of APRin significantly contribute to the binding between APRin and APR. In particular, Ser1 binds strongly to Zn2+ as well as to the sidechains of His176(Hid), His180(Hid), and His186(Hid) in APR. This is the main reason for the strong interaction between APR and APRin. The results also elucidated significant contributions of the positively charged Arg83 and Arg90 residues of APRin to the binding with APR. These findings may provide information useful for the design of novel small agents as potent APR inhibitors.},

  abstract = {We describe a comparative protein modelling method designed to find the most probable structure for a sequence given its alignment with related structures. The three-dimensional (3D) model is obtained by optimally satisfying spatial restraints derived from the alignment and expressed as probability density functions (pdfs) for the features restrained. For example, the probabilities for main-chain conformations of a modelled residue may be restrained by its residue type, main-chain conformation of an equivalent residue in a related protein, and the local similarity between the two sequences. Several such pdfs are obtained from the correlations between structural features in 17 families of homologous proteins which have been aligned on the basis of their 3D structures. The pdfs restrain C alpha-C alpha distances, main-chain N-O distances, main-chain and side-chain dihedral angles. A smoothing procedure is used in the derivation of these relationships to minimize the problem of a sparse database. The 3D model of a protein is obtained by optimization of the molecular pdf such that the model violates the input restraints as little as possible. The molecular pdf is derived as a combination of pdfs restraining individual spatial features of the whole molecule. The optimization procedure is a variable target function method that applies the conjugate gradients algorithm to positions of all non-hydrogen atoms. The method is automated and is illustrated by the modelling of trypsin from two other serine proteinases.},

  abstract = {Deep learning (DL), a branch of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) is nowadays considered as a core technology of today's Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR or Industry 4.0). Due to its learning capabilities from data, DL technology originated from artificial neural network (ANN), has become a hot topic in the context of computing, and is widely applied in various application areas like healthcare, visual recognition, text analytics,~cybersecurity, and many more. However, building an appropriate DL model is a challenging task, due to the dynamic nature and variations in real-world problems and data. Moreover, the lack of core understanding turns DL methods into black-box machines that hamper development at the standard level. This article presents a structured and comprehensive view on DL techniques including a taxonomy considering various types of real-world tasks like supervised or unsupervised. In our taxonomy, we take into account deep networks for supervised or discriminative learning, unsupervised or generative learning as well as hybrid learning and relevant others. We also summarize real-world application areas where deep learning techniques can be used. Finally, we point out ten potential aspects for future generation DL modeling with research directions. Overall, this article aims to draw a big picture on DL modeling that can be used as a reference guide for both academia and industry professionals.},

In addition to the 'classic' species of mRNA, tRNA, rRNA, snRNA and snoRNA, it is now clear that the majority of genomic information is transcribed into RNA molecules. The resulting complexity of the transcriptome poses a serious challenge to cells because they must manage numerous RNA-processing reactions, yet, at the same time, eradicate surplus and aberrant material without destroying functional RNA. The 3'--{$>$}5' exonucleolytic RNA exosome is emerging as a major facilitator of such events. Recent structural and functional data regarding this fascinating complex and its many co-factors illuminate its diverse biochemical properties and indicate mechanisms by which RNAs are targeted for either processing or degradation.},

While convolutional neural networks have proven to be the first choice for images, audio and video data, the atoms in molecules are not restricted to a grid. Instead, their precise locations contain essential physical information, that would get lost if discretized. Thus, we propose to use continuous-filter convolutional layers to be able to model local correlations without requiring the data to lie on a grid. We apply those layers in SchNet: a novel deep learning architecture modeling quantum interactions in molecules. We obtain a joint model for the total energy and interatomic forces that follows fundamental quantum-chemical principles. This includes rotationally invariant energy predictions and a smooth, differentiable potential energy surface. Our architecture achieves state-of-the-art performance for benchmarks of equilibrium molecules and molecular dynamics trajectories. Finally, we introduce a more challenging benchmark with chemical and structural variations that suggests the path for further work.},

Using Xenopus laevis egg extract, we found that increases in cytosolic calcium lead to the activation of an endogenous ribonuclease, XendoU. A fraction of XendoU localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is required for nuclear envelope assembly and ER network formation in a catalysis-dependent manner. Using a purified vesicle fusion assay, we show that XendoU functions on the surface of ER membranes to promote RNA cleavage and ribonucleoprotein (RNP) removal. Additionally, RNA removal from the surface of vesicles by RNase treatment leads to increased ER network formation. Using human tissue culture cells, we found that hEndoU localizes to the ER, where it promotes the formation of ER tubules in a catalysis-dependent manner. Together, these results demonstrate that calcium-activated removal of RNA from membranes by XendoU promotes and refines ER remodeling and the formation of tubular ER.},

Using the probability theory, we derive an atomic distance-dependent statistical potential from a sample of native structures that does not depend on any adjustable parameters (Discrete Optimized Protein Energy, or DOPE). DOPE is based on an improved reference state that corresponds to noninteracting atoms in a homogeneous sphere with the radius dependent on a sample native structure; it thus accounts for the finite and spherical shape of the native structures. The DOPE potential was extracted from a nonredundant set of 1472 crystallographic structures. We tested DOPE and five other scoring functions by the detection of the native state among six multiple target decoy sets, the correlation between the score and model error, and the identification of the most accurate non-native structure in the decoy set. For all decoy sets, DOPE is the best performing function in terms of all criteria, except for a tie in one criterion for one decoy set. To facilitate its use in various applications, such as model assessment, loop modeling, and fitting into cryo-electron microscopy mass density maps combined with comparative protein structure modeling, DOPE was incorporated into the modeling package MODELLER-8.},

  abstract = {Understanding the finely orchestrated interactions leading to or preventing programmed cell death (apoptosis) is of utmost importance in cancer research because the failure of these systems could eventually lead to the onset of the disease. In this regard, the maintenance of a delicate balance between the promoters and inhibitors of mitochondrial apoptosis is crucial, as demonstrated by the interplay among the Bcl-2 family members. In particular, B-cell lymphoma extra-large (Bcl-xL) is a target of interest due to the forefront role of its dysfunctions in cancer development. Bcl-xL prevents apoptosis by binding both the pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins, like PUMA, and the noncanonical partners, such as p53, at different sites. An allosteric communication between the BH3-only protein binding pocket and the p53 binding site, mediating the release of p53 from Bcl-xL upon PUMA binding, has been postulated and supported by nuclear magnetic resonance and other biophysical data. The molecular details of this mechanism, especially at the residue level, remain unclear. In this work, we investigated the distal communication between these two sites in Bcl-xL in its free state and when bound to PUMA. We also evaluated how missense mutations of Bcl-xL found in cancer samples might impair this communication and therefore the allosteric mechanism. We employed all-atom explicit solvent microsecond molecular dynamics simulations, analyzed through a Protein Structure Network approach and integrated with calculations of changes in free energies upon cancer-related mutations identified by genomics studies. We found a subset of candidate residues responsible for both maintaining protein stability and for conveying structural information between the two binding sites and hypothesized possible communication routes between specific residues at both sites.},

Unbiased analysis of glycolytic drivers identified the hyaluronan-mediated motility receptor as among the most highly correlated with glycolysis in cancer. Confirming a mechanistic link between the ECM component hyaluronan and metabolism, treatment of cells and xenografts with hyaluronidase triggers a robust increase in glycolysis. This is largely achieved through rapid receptor tyrosine kinase-mediated induction of mRNA decay factor ZFP36, which targets TXNIP transcripts for degradation. Since TXNIP promotes internalization of the glucose transporter GLUT1, its acute decline enriches GLUT1 at the plasma membrane. Functionally, induction of glycolysis by hyaluronidase is required for concomitant acceleration of cell migration. This interconnection between ECM remodeling and metabolism is exhibited in dynamic tissue states including tumorigenesis and embryogenesis., The breakdown of extracellular matrix promotes increased tumor cell migration via upregulation of glycolysis.,},

Enzymatic ENDU-2 defects localized in the ADL and certain muscle cells led to increased cold tolerance in endu-2 mutants. Ca2+ imaging revealed ADL neurons were responsive to temperature stimuli through transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, concluding that ADL function requires ENDU-2 action in both cell-autonomous and cell-nonautonomous mechanisms.

  abstract = {The heterotrimeric G protein family plays essential roles during a varied array of cellular events; thus, its deregulation can seriously alter signaling events and the overall state of the cell. Heterotrimeric G-proteins have three subunits ({$\alpha$}, {$\beta$}, {$\gamma$}) and are subdivided into four families, G{$\alpha$}i, G{$\alpha$}12/13, G{$\alpha$}q, and G{$\alpha$}s. These proteins cycle between an inactive G{$\alpha$}-GDP state and active G{$\alpha$}-GTP state, triggered canonically by the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) and by other accessory proteins receptors independent also known as AGS (Activators of G-protein Signaling). In this review, we summarize research data specific for the G{$\alpha$}i family. This family has the largest number of individual members, including G{$\alpha$}i1, G{$\alpha$}i2, G{$\alpha$}i3, G{$\alpha$}o, G{$\alpha$}t, G{$\alpha$}g, and G{$\alpha$}z, and constitutes the majority of G proteins {$\alpha$} subunits expressed in a tissue or cell. G{$\alpha$}i was initially described by its inhibitory function on adenylyl cyclase activity, decreasing cAMP levels. Interestingly, today Gi family G-protein have been reported to be importantly involved in the immune system function. Here, we discuss the impact of G{$\alpha$}i on non-canonical effector proteins, such as c-Src, ERK1/2, phospholipase-C (PLC), and proteins from the Rho GTPase family members, all of them essential signaling pathways regulating a wide range of physiological processes.},

  abstract = {A small change in the Hamiltonian scaling in Replica Exchange with Solute Tempering (REST) is found to improve its sampling efficiency greatly, especially for the sampling of aqueous protein solutions in which there are large-scale solute conformation changes. Like the original REST (REST1), the new version (which we call REST2) also bypasses the poor scaling with system size of the standard Temperature Replica Exchange Method (TREM), reducing the number of replicas (parallel processes) from what must be used in TREM. This reduction is accomplished by deforming the Hamiltonian function for each replica in such a way that the acceptance probability for the exchange of replica configurations does not depend on the number of explicit water molecules in the system. For proof of concept, REST2 is compared with TREM and with REST1 for the folding of the trpcage and {$\beta$}-hairpin in water. The comparisons confirm that REST2 greatly reduces the number of CPUs required by regular replica exchange and greatly increases the sampling efficiency over REST1. This method reduces the CPU time required for calculating thermodynamic averages and for the ab initio folding of proteins in explicit water.},

  abstract = {Identifying drug--protein interactions (DPIs) is crucial in drug discovery, and a number of machine learning methods have been developed to predict DPIs. Existing methods usually use unrealistic data sets with hidden bias, which will limit the accuracy of virtual screening methods. Meanwhile, most DPI prediction methods pay more attention to molecular representation but lack effective research on protein representation and high-level associations between different instances. To this end, we present the novel structure-aware multimodal deep DPI prediction model, STAMP-DPI, which was trained on a curated industry-scale benchmark data set. We built a high-quality benchmark data set named GalaxyDB for DPI prediction. This industry-scale data set along with an unbiased training procedure resulted in a more robust benchmark study. For informative protein representation, we constructed a structure-aware graph neural network method from the protein sequence by combining predicted contact maps and graph neural networks. Through further integration of structure-based representation and high-level pretrained embeddings for molecules and proteins, our model effectively captures the feature representation of the interactions between them. As a result, STAMP-DPI outperformed state-of-the-art DPI prediction methods by decreasing 7.00\% mean square error (MSE) in the Davis data set and improving 8.89\% area under the curve (AUC) in the GalaxyDB data set. Moreover, our model is an interpretable model with the transformer-based interaction mechanism, which can accurately reveal the binding sites between molecules and proteins.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a leading cancer with high morbidity and mortality worldwide. The aim is to identify genes with clinical significance by integrated bioinformatics analysis and investigate their function in HNSCC. METHODS: We downloaded and analyzed two gene expression datasets of GSE6631 and GSE107591 to screen differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in HNSCC. Common DEGs were functionally analyzed by Gene ontology and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed with STRING database and Cytoscape. ENDOU was overexpressed in FaDu and Cal-27 cell lines, and cell proliferation and migration capability were evaluated with MTT, scratch and transwell assay. The prognostic performance of ENDOU and expression correlation with tumor infiltrates in HNSCC were validated with TCGA HNSCC datasets. RESULTS: Ninety-eight genes shared common differential expression in both datasets, with core functions like extracellular matrix organization significantly enriched. 15 genes showed prognostic significance, and COBL and ENDOU serve as independent survival markers in HNSCC. In-vitro ENDOU overexpression inhibited FaDu and Cal-27 cells proliferation and migration, indicating its tumor-suppressing role in HNSCC progression. GSEA analysis indicated ENDOU down-stream pathways like DNA replication, mismatch repair, cell cycle and IL-17 signaling pathway. ENDOU showed relative lower expression in HNSCC, especially HPV-positive HNSCC samples. At last, ENDOU showed negative correlation with tumor purity and tumor infiltrating macrophages, especially M2 macrophages. CONCLUSION: This study identified ENDOU as a biomarker with prognostic significance in HNSCC progression.},

  abstract = {Introduction PaDEL-Descriptor is a software for calculating molecular descriptors and fingerprints. The software currently calculates 797 descriptors (663 1D, 2D descriptors, and 134 3D descriptors) and 10 types of fingerprints. These descriptors and fingerprints are calculated mainly using The Chemistry Development Kit. Some additional descriptors and fingerprints were added, which include atom type electrotopological state descriptors, McGowan volume, molecular linear free energy relation descriptors, ring counts, count of chemical substructures identified by Laggner, and binary fingerprints and count of chemical substructures identified by Klekota and Roth. Methods PaDEL-Descriptor was developed using the Java language and consists of a library component and an interface component. The library component allows it to be easily integrated into quantitative structure activity relationship software to provide the descriptor calculation feature while the interface component allows it to be used as a standalone software. The software uses a Master/Worker pattern to take advantage of the multiple CPU cores that are present in most modern computers to speed up calculations of molecular descriptors. Results The software has several advantages over existing standalone molecular descriptor calculation software. It is free and open source, has both graphical user interface and command line interfaces, can work on all major platforms (Windows, Linux, MacOS), supports more than 90 different molecular file formats, and is multithreaded. Conclusion PaDEL-Descriptor is a useful addition to the currently available molecular descriptor calculation software.

  abstract = {Most molecular generative models based on artificial intelligence for de novo drug design are ligand-centric and do not consider the detailed three-dimensional geometries of protein binding pockets. Pocket-aware three-dimensional molecular generation is challenging due to the need to impose physical equivariance and to evaluate protein--ligand interactions when incrementally growing partially built molecules. Inspired by multiscale modelling in condensed matter and statistical physics, we present a three-dimensional molecular generative model conditioned on protein pockets, termed ResGen, for designing organic molecules inside of a given target. ResGen is built on the principle of parallel multiscale modelling, which can capture higher-level interaction and achieve higher computational efficiency (about eight-times faster than the previous best art). The generation process is formulated as a hierarchical autoregression, that is, a global autoregression for learning protein--ligand interactions and atomic component autoregression for learning each atom's topology and geometry distributions. We demonstrate that ResGen has a higher success rate than existing state-of-the-art approaches in generating novel molecules that can bind to unseen targets more tightly than the original ligands. Moreover, retrospective computational experiments on de novo drug design in real-world scenarios show that ResGen successfully generates drug-like molecules with lower binding energy and higher diversity than state-of-the-art approaches.},

In particular, {$\pi$}-{$\pi$} stacking interactions have potential application in a comprehensive range of biomedical and biotechnological fields. Because they do not alter structural or functional properties of drugs, {$\pi$}-{$\pi$} stacking interactions have been used as a driving force in loading drugs into delivery systems, and in the design of self-assembling systems.

  abstract = {Deep generative modeling has a strong potential to accelerate drug design. However, existing generative models often face challenges in generalization due to limited data, leading to less innovative designs with often unfavorable interactions for unseen target proteins. To address these issues, we propose an interaction-aware 3D molecular generative framework that enables interaction-guided drug design inside target binding pockets. By leveraging universal patterns of protein-ligand interactions as prior knowledge, our model can achieve high generalizability with limited experimental data. Its performance has been comprehensively assessed by analyzing generated ligands for unseen targets in terms of binding pose stability, affinity, geometric patterns, diversity, and novelty. Moreover, the effective design of potential mutant-selective inhibitors demonstrates the applicability of our approach to structure-based drug design.},
